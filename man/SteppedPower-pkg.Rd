\description{
SteppedPower offers tools for power and sample size
calculation as well as design diagnostics for
longitudinal mixed model settings, with a focus on stepped wedge designs.
All calculations are oracle estimates i.e. assume random effect variances
to be known (or guessed) in advance.
