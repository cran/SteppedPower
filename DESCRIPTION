Description: Tools for power and sample size 
    calculation as well as design diagnostics for 
    longitudinal mixed model settings, with a focus on stepped wedge designs.
    All calculations are oracle estimates i.e. assume random effect variances 
    to be known (or guessed) in advance.  
    The method is introduced in Hussey and Hughes (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2006.05.007>,
    extensions are discussed in Li et al. (2020) <doi:10.1177/0962280220932962>.
